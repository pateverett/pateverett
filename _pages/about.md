I'm Patrick and welcome to my site! This site is a fun side project to serve as inspiration as I learn web development.

I grew up in Ann Arbor, MI and am a die-hard Michigan fan - arguably to a fault.

I work as a [Nuclear Engineer](/resume/) at [Oklo](https://www.oklo.com "Oklo") and take great pride in being able to work towards bringing clean energy to the world in a safe, sustainable, and prosperous manner. I believe that nuclear fission is humanity's greatest invention, and I'm dedicated towards bringing the promise of the Atomic Era to the modern world.

In my free time, my favorite things to do are [SCUBA diving](/scuba/) and cooking.

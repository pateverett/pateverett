I'm Patrick and welcome to my site! This is a fun side project to serve as inspiration to learn the ins and outs of web development.

I grew up in Ann Arbor, MI and am a die-hard Michigan fan - almost to a fault.

I work as a [Nuclear Engineer](/professional/) at [Oklo](www.oklo.com) and take great pride in being able to work towards bringing clean energy to the world in a safe, sustainable, and prosperous manner. I'm confident that nuclear fission is humanity's greatest invention, and I'm dedicated towards bringing the promise of the Atomic Era to the modern world.

In my free time, two of my favorite things to do are [SCUBA diving](/scuba/) and cooking - in some cases, I've been able to put the two together for some of the best meals of my life.

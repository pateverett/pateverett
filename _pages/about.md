I'm Patrick and welcome to my site! This site is a fun side project to serve as inspiration as I learn web development and progress my skills as an underwater photographer.

I grew up in Ann Arbor, MI and am a die-hard Michigan fan. I try to go to a couple games at the Big House every year.

I work as a [Nuclear Engineer](/resume/) at [Oklo](https://www.oklo.com "Oklo") and take great pride in being able to work towards bringing clean energy to the world in a safe, sustainable, and prosperous manner. I believe that nuclear fission is humanity's greatest invention, and I'm dedicated towards bringing the promise of the Atomic Era to the modern world.

My favorite reactor of all time is the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II), which operated in Idaho Falls from 1965 to 1994. EBR-II and the adjacent facilities were used to recycle fuel *and put it back into the reactor* and were some of the most incredible machines ever operated.

In my free time, my favorite things to do are [SCUBA diving](/scuba/) and cooking.

I hope you enjoy my site!

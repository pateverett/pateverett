I took a trip aboard the Jelajahi Laut Liveaboard to explore the Raja Ampat areas of Indonesia.

We departed from Sorong and started our diving in central Raja Ampat, diving in the Dampier straight at Cape Kri, Sardine Reef and Mikeâ€™s Point, then went south to the islands of Misool, diving within the Misool Eco Reserve area and the islands of Romeo and Yillet. We also swam in the Lenmakana Jellyfish Lake alongside the stingless jellyfish, one of a few worldwide.

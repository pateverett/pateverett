I took a trip to dive in Cozumel, Mexico in August 2023. I dove with [ScubaTony](https://www.scubatony.com) and can't say enough great things about their diving operation. Their guides are knowledgable about the sites and always willing to accomodate the divers' requests. Among a dozen or so sites, some of the best were the following:

- Palancar Horseshoe
- Paso del Cedral
- Yucab Reef
- Santa Rosa Wall
- Palancar Gardens

Cozumel is known for its drift diving - strong currents generally don't go well with photography, but the conditions were favorable enough to get these shots.

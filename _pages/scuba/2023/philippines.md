I took a trip aboard the M-Y Infiniti Liveaboard to explore the Visayas.

Starting from Cebu, we traveled north to Kimud Shoal and Gato Island, then headed
south to Anda, Napantaw, and Padre Burgos.

We saw the famous thresher sharks, frogfish, pygmy sea horses, and about a million other creatures.

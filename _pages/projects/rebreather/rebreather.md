Gas moves back and forth from lungs to the counterlungs through the scrubber. Human moves the gas through the loop.

Simplest oxygen rebreathers are "pendulum rebreathers," where the gas does not move in a loop.

Aylo's rebreather is slightly more sophisticated to move gas in a loop using a one-way valve in the mouthpiece.

This is achieved by a one-way valve in the mouthpeice. It only allows exhalation to one side of the scrubber, and inhalation from the opposite side of the scrubber. In a pendulum rebreather, it is easy to have dead volume on the ends of the pendulum- short breaths can create a buildup of CO2 which is bad. This is less likely to happen with a loop.
